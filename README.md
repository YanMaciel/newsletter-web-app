# Newsletter Web App
![](/finance_portfolio.png)

# Description
This is a basic web app via which you can subscribe to receive a Newsletter from someone or a company using Mailchimp's API Server.

# Created with 
This application uses Node.js, Express.js, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. It also uses Mailchimp's API to register the subscriber's First Name, Last Name and their e-mail, as the image below:

# Usage 
It's a subscribing page that asks for the user's first and last name as well as their e-mail.

If the signing up is succesfully proceeded a "success" HTML page will be rendered. If it's not, then a "failure" HTML page will be rendered with a "Try again" button that returns to the signing up page.

This is a toy app just for practice and I have not implemented a whole lot of security features.

# Access
You can access the webp app at: https://newsletter-web-app-2207.herokuapp.com/

# What I learned
Mainly to work with Node.js and the Express.js Framework for the back-end development.

Further learning of: JavaScript, JSON, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, MVC, Heroku, Unix commands, GIT and version control, as well as API authentication and usage.

I also learned how to deploy an web app on Heroku via their CLI using GIT and version control. 

It was a great experience in which I was able to learn new technologies and reinforce previously learned concepts!
